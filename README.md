## Basic Chess Rules

1. **Objective**: The goal of chess is to checkmate the opponent's **King**. This means the king is under threat and cannot escape.
   
2. **Chessboard**: The game is played on an 8x8 chessboard with alternating light and dark squares.

3. **Piece Moves**:
   - **King**: Moves one square in any direction.
   - **Queen**: Moves any number of squares in any direction.
   - **Rook**: Moves any number of squares vertically or horizontally.
   - **Bishop**: Moves any number of squares diagonally.
   - **Knight**: Moves in an "L" shape (two squares in one direction, then one square in a perpendicular direction).
   - **Pawn**: Moves one square forward, but on the first move, it can move two squares. It captures diagonally.

4. **Check**: When a player's king is under threat, it's called "check." The player must protect the king by either moving it, placing another piece between it and the threat, or capturing the threatening piece.

5. **Checkmate**: When a player's king is checkmated, the game is over, and the other player wins.
